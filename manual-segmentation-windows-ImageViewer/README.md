## manual-segmentation-windows-ImageViewer

This is a tool for quick-and-dirty manual segmentation of a group of images. It uses [ImageViewer](https://github.com/KitwareMedical/ImageViewer) to perform annotations.

### Usage

Download/clone this folder anywhere on your windows machine. Copy all of the images you wish to manually segment into the subfolder "images to be annotated". Then open this folder in File Explorer, and double click on "annotate_with_ImageViewer.bat". This will open a Command Prompt window--read the instructions from there.
